This is just vibe coded Terminal that i made for personal usage. <br>
Why?<br>
Well cause I'm annoyed with copy+c copy+v and tracking clipboard history of commands all the time,
so i made this terminal. <br> It's just testing version that will be used in my linux desktop enviroment I'm making.
It won't use electron. <br> And i won't bother adding themes and settings for it now, i just need history to work. <br>
You just click command from history tab and it gets executed, or you right click to paste it into input. <br>
It's just for linux <br> <br>
