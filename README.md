This is just vibe coded Terminal that i made for personal usage. <br>
Why?<br>
Well cause I'm annoyed with copy+c copy+v and tracking clipboard history of commands all the time,
so i made this terminal. <br> It's just testing version that will be used in my linux desktop enviroment I'm making.
It won't use electron. <br> And i won't bother adding themes and settings for it now, i just need history to work. <br>You 
You just click command from history tab and it gets executed, or you right click to paste it into input. <br> <br>
Why is it better then others?<br>
-Eaiser to execute previous commands from history<br>
-Eaiser to clear input<br>
-Quick password button<br>
-Install based on selection<br>
-It auto adds sudo to pacman, apt-get. Cause WHY NOT? Why just warn me i need sudo and waste my time... (broken currently)<br><br>
AI won't be added, but I'm considering it
<br>
It's just for linux <br>
<br>
To fix:<br>
-Theme settings (hue, brightness, opacity)<br>
-Window detachment, new window launching<br>
-Input bar affecting CSS and input bar autocomplete missing <br>
-Settings/Control aliases missing scroll overflow CSS <br>
-Beep notification when terminal stops printing when minimized, not working <br>
-Add option to close split view and change orientation <br> <br>
