**Demonstration video** - <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjWb9IDcWO0'>Link</a> <br> <br>
This is just vibe coded Terminal that i made for personal usage. <br>

**Why i made this?**<br>
Well cause I'm annoyed with copy+c copy+v and tracking clipboard history of commands all the time,
so i made this terminal. <br> It's just testing version that will be used in my linux desktop enviroment I'm making.
It won't use electron. <br>
You just click command from history tab and it gets executed, or you right click to paste it into input.<br>
It's just for Linux, but can be built for Windows <br> <br>
**Why is it better then others?**<br>
-Eaiser to execute previous commands from history<br>
-Eaiser to clear input<br>
-Quick password button<br>
-Install based on selection<br>
-It auto adds sudo to pacman, apt-get. Cause WHY NOT? Why just warn me i need sudo and waste my time... (broken currently)<br>

**To fix:**<br>
-Window detachment missing<br>
-Input bar affecting CSS and input bar autocomplete missing <br>
-Beep notification when terminal stops printing when minimized, not working <br>
-Drag file into terminal to paste file path not working <br>
-Add option to close split view and change orientation <br>
-Theme options in settings <br>
